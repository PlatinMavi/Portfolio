                <p className="text-lg text-slate-100 px-4 pb-12"><span className="px-4"></span>I am Alper Gezer. I am a self proclaimed "Web Devolper" :D, and love to work on projects. <br />
                 I have always been keen on coding and when i got my first computer, i hacked nasa. Well, i tried to but since i am not a kid whose a genius or smth. i couldn't :D. I am 16 years old, from Turkey
                 and been coding for 4 years. Alongside with Web Devolopment, i worked with AI, Webscraping and more... I am interested in learning languages, which has also lead me to have an excellent
                 English (thanks dad), and a bit of German. I am used to working with teams, contributing to open source projects and else. I belive i would be a great fit with in most senarios and able to adapt very fast.
                 And lastly, i am still at highschool. (Dont look down on me for that, i could me more than you think...) I am confident (cant talk to the girl i like). </p>
